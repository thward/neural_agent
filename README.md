#Reinforcement Learning Neural Network

Reinforcement Learning (RL) source code for [A Threshold-based Scheme for Reinforcement Learning in Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03348) 

##Features
- Supervised & Unsupervised (RL) backpropagation
- Threshold Assignment of Patterns (TAP): primary Reinforcement with action creation 
- Threshold Assignment of Rewards (TAR): conditioned Reinforcement
- Threshold Assignment of Connections (TAC): biologically inspired alternative to backpropagation
- Bluetooth connectivity for Arduino micro-controller
